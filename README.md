This project is made using the flask framework. You need to set up a virtual environment before downloading flask and any other necessary packages. I used MongoDB for database, but you're free to use any database you're comfortable with. However, if you want to use MongoDB, you'll have to create an account on MongoDB atlas website. From there, you can follow the steps to download MongoDB compass GUI for your desktop and start using the database.
